# concertProject
This project recieves data from musicians.txt and instruments.txt files, inputs the data into an instrumentTree and a list of musicians,
stores the data and creates a concert.
The concert consists of a group of musicians that play the requested instruments (the user inputs the information needed to create the concert).
If the instrument is important, the most expensive musician which is available is assigned to play it in the concert.
if the instrument is not important, the cheapest musician, who knows how to play the instrument and is available, is hired.
